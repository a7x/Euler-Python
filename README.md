Euler-Python
============

This repository has solutions to project euler problems. Please try the problems yourself first! These solutions are here to make me realize how my python code is changing with time :) hopefully for the better. 

And these solutions are here for your reference if you are stuck. 

Project Euler problems are fun! 

Please please do let me know if some solution can be made better. I would love to know about it! 

The problems aren't organized completely. In some cases, multiple problems are part of the same python script. This is pointed out in the name of the script
